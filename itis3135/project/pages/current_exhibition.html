                    <p class="exhibition-date">April 1 - May 31, 2025</p>
                    <p>Experience the majesty of mountain landscapes through the eyes of contemporary artists. This exhibition explores the intersection of natural grandeur and human interpretation, featuring works that capture the ethereal beauty of alpine environments. From misty morning peaks to dramatic sunset silhouettes, each piece invites viewers to contemplate the timeless relationship between humanity and these ancient geological formations. The collection includes both traditional and innovative approaches to landscape painting, offering a diverse perspective on one of nature's most awe-inspiring subjects.</p>
                    
                    <p>Featured artists include Mei Zhang, whose oil paintings bridge Eastern and Western artistic traditions, and Erik Andersson, whose watercolor works capture the dramatic coastal scenes of his native Sweden. Together, these artists present a comprehensive exploration of mountain environments across different cultures and artistic styles.</p>
                    
                    <p>The exhibition also includes special events throughout its duration, including artist talks, painting demonstrations, and guided tours. On the opening night, April 1st, visitors will have the opportunity to meet the artists and gain insight into their creative processes and inspirations. The gallery will host a special "Sunset Viewing" event on May 15th, where selected works will be displayed in natural evening light to showcase their dynamic qualities.</p>
