        <h2>Contract Page</h2>
        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Hunter S. Beachum</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in
            my Spring 2025, ITIS 3135, Web-Based Application Design &amp; Development with my instructor, Professor D.I.
            von Briesen.</p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and
            will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
            failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
        <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples
            online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and
            will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never
            from my classmates.</p>
        <p>Signed: <em>Hunter S. Beachum, 3/2/2025</em></p>
