        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: Grew up all along the east coast, mostly NC/VA, moved to Charlotte 3 years ago to
                live with my brother while he completed his pre-med at UNCC and decided to get a degree myself while I
                was at it.</li>
            <li>Professional background: I've worked on my software development portfolio in preparation for internship
                applications, hoping to get my feet on the ground in the professional software dev world this summer.
                Previously I've worked as an independent contractor doing transcription work.</li>
            <li>Academic background: Associates in Computer Programming from Wake Tech, transferred to UNCC to complete
                my B.S. and I am considering the Master's program.</li>
            <li>Background in this subject: Did some web application development at Wake Tech using python with a Flask
                web framework and MySQL integration.</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows Laptop for class, Windows Desktop at home</li>
            <li>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:
                <ul>
                    <li>ITSC 3688 Computers and Their Impact on Society - Looking forward to learning some soft skills
                        in this required course.</li>
                    <li>ITCS 3160 Database Design and Implementation - I'm interested in learning more ways to utilize
                        Databases and brushing up on my SQL skills.</li>
                    <li>ITSC 3146 Intro to Operating Systems and Networking - Already met some great students in this
                        class, and looking forward to learning about threading and network infrastructure.</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3200 Intro to Info Security and Privacy - Taking this to maintain a pivot position for both
                        the Cyber concentration and the Web Apps concentration as I decide. I'm sure I'll learn a lot
                        here.</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3135 Web Based Application Design and Development - While I learn more about the other
                        concentrations, I am expecting that Web Dev/Software Engineering is my number one, so I'm very
                        excited to grow my skills in that field in this course.</li>
                    <li>JAPN 1202 Elementary Japanese II - This one's just for me, I like video games and manga so I
                        decided to take a spin at Japanese, and it has been great fun to study it formally.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I used to play Dance Dance Revolution competitively. It's a great
                game, and great exercise.</li>
            <li>I'd also like to share: I love cats. Huge cat fan. Thinking about adopting one soon.</li>
        </ul>
