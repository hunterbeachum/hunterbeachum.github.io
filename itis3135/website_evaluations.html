        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <h3>Good Website Design: <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a></h3>
        <p class="summary">Itch.io is an indie game marketplace that allows developers to sell their games and other creative content directly to players.</p>
        <ul class="evaluation">
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Itch.io uses bold and high-contrast color schemes to make key navigation elements stand out clearly.
                This makes the website easy to navigate, with an emphasis on important actions and drawing attention to the products the site is promiting.</li>
                                        
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The design uses repetition to provide easy transition from game topics.  It uses consistent color schemes and typography throughout the pages.
                This helps users stay focused on the content and makes the interface feel cohesive despite varied layouts for different games.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The website uses good alignment in terms of placing images and text in a balanced way.
                Games are displayed in grids or lists, and each product page has a clear layout that makes browsing easy for users.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The website groups related content together, making it easy for users to find what they are looking for.
                For example, reviews, game descriptions, and prices are placed near each other, providing a convenient experience with minimal effort.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Poor Website Design: <a href="http://www.seiryu-kan.com/">seiryu-kan.com</a></h3>
        <p class="summary">Seiryu-kan.com is an outdated, cluttered website that struggles with basic design principles, leading to a frustrating user experience.</p>
        <ul class="evaluation">
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website suffers from poor contrast, with text in dark colors on complicated dark backgrounds, making it difficult to read.
                Key actions, such as buttons or links, aren't highlighted effectively, and super inconsistent contrast makes them sometimes hard to spot, making me unsure of where to click.</li>   
            
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There's a lack of consistency in design elements across the site.
                Font colors vary from section to section, creating a disjointed experience.  Some of the content is presented as tables while other large portions are presented as images.
                site feel unpolished and challenging to navigate.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The website features poorly aligned text, images, and tables.  Tables are inconsistently and unevenly distributed.
                Content is scattered across the page without clear structure, making it hard for users to digest the information or follow any logical progression when browsing.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is scattered across the page in a highly vertical format, forcing the user to scroll to see me.
                The lack of logical grouping makes it difficult to focus on any one section, leading to a cluttered and overwhelming experience.</li>
        </ul>
