            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my reflective portfolio for EDUC 1511 - Public Education and Schooling.</p>
            <p>I am a Senior at UNC Charlotte majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Web Development and Software Engineering.  
                This portfolio highlists how my perspective on teaching has evolved this semester, not just as a student but as a future educator, 
                advocate, and member of my community.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout this course, I've developed a deeper understanding of the role of the teacher.  This understanding includes a perspective on 
                teaching's history in the United States, the challenges teachers face, and the strategies and responsibilities of teachers. 
            </p>
            <p>I'm also excited to share that I'll be serving as an Instructional Assistant for ITSC 3146: Operating Systems and Networking in Fall 2025.  This role 
                has offered me a more personal connection to what I've learned in this course, and strengthened my commitment to creating a compassionate and effective 
                learning environment wherever I teach.
            </p>

            <h2>As a Learner</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>At the outset of this course, we were asked to consider why were are learning.  In pursuing this understanding of myself, I discovered that 
                understanding this why has helped me stay motivated as a student.  As a Computer Science major, that "why" is the joy of building useful things 
                and sharing them with others.  Serving as an Instructional Assistant this fall is an opportunity for me to stay connected to that purpose.
            </p>
            <p>This course also helped me shed a positive light on my family background.  The diverse set of backgrounds and perspectives in my family
                has taught me to see problems from different perspectives, and to understand that a teacher's perspective might not be the only valid one.
                This understanding will help me stay flexible in my role as a teacher, which I hope will allow me to grow alongside students.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>We were later asked to reflect on the Self Made Man statue on UNCC campus, and consider how our Self Made Man statue would differ from it.  
                This reflection helped me to realize that while personal drive is important, my growth as a learner has always been shaped by others.  
                Family, friends, and teachers would all be featured in my Self Made Man Statue, as they provide the support I need in order to make myself into a student
                that I can be proud of.
            </p>
            <p>To continue to grow as a lifelong learner, I need to focus on staying grateful and connected to the people who have helped me.  This is sometimes a difficult task 
                for me, as I have a tendency to be introverted, so having the opportunity to put this into words has helped me learn how I need to change to accomplish my goals.
                Success, while possible in isolation, is something most often found through shared effort.  This perspective helps me stay humble and driven to support others in return.

            <h2>As an Advocate</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>Writing about teachers' unions showed me that being an advocate for education means supporting the people who make education possible.
                I had previously considered unions only in terms of wages and job security, but the research that I did for this assignment showed me the role
                unions also play in protecting teacher voices, resisting harmful privatization, and improving learning conditions for students.
            </p>
            <p>This assignment helped me see that if I become a teacher, or even just as a politically and democratically engaged citizen, I have a role to play
                in supporting fair, equitable environments for both educators and their students.  Protections for teachers create better outcomes for students,
                especially those in disadvantaged communities.
            </p>

                </a>
            </figure>
            <p>For my clinical observation hours, I spent some time watching the Annenberg Learner teaching videos.  These videos helped me understand how much planning,
                 organization, and collaboration go into teaching.  Seeing teachers share strategies and reflect on student growth reminded me that teaching is both 
                 personal and professional.  It's about connecting with both students and other educators.  The emphasis on mentorship and the vast array of resources available 
                 online for teachers gives me confidence that teachers do not have to tackle their important work alone.
            </p>
            <p>I also learned that teaching today requires adaptability.  With new technologies like AI and evolving student needs, educators must use these collaborative 
                resources, such as perspectives offered in the the Cult of Pedagogy Blog and Podcast, to stay informed and flexible.  These observations helped me to understand 
                that teachers aren't just instructors who deliver content to their students, but also lifelong learners in a rapidly changing world.  This is true also for 
                Computer Science: the changing technological landscape demands adaptability and constant learning.

            </figure>
            <p>Exploring the history of public education in the United States helped me understand how culture can impact access to opportunity.  I was struck by how 
                long race and gender have limited who gets to learn, and just how recent many educational rights actually are.  Learning about the fight for minority
                education gave me a clearer view of the struggles others have faced and how those experiences shape their lives today.
            </p>
            <p>This assignment showed me that being a good community members means staying open to different viewpoints and recognizing that equity is not something 
                that we have achieved in our society today, rather it is something we must continue to fight for every day.  The timeline assignment reminded me that 
                progress requires effort, both to move forward towards a fair and equitable society while also resisting the forces pushing us backwards.

                <figcaption>Waiting for Superman</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>For my clinical observation hours, I watched Waiting for Superman.  This movie helped me see how unequal access to education shapes people's entire lives, 
                and how much that inequality is tied to larger, systemic issues.  The lottery scenes would be heartbreaking to any conscientious citizen, and they demonstrate 
                how class and culture can limit opportunity from the start.
            </p>
            <p>I learned that understanding different viewpoints, such as those in the film that were critical of teacher's unions, is important even if I cannot fully 
                reconcile my viewpoint with another.  These incongruities force me to think critically about how we fund education and how we can accomplish the much-needed 
                reform without laying the blame at the feet of teachers.  Being an engaged community member means staying informed, so that we are able to advocate for fairness 
                wherever and whenever possible.
            </p>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
            <p>This semester offered me an opportunity to reflect on the depth and complexity of the role of educators.  I believe that education is not just a way for us to pass 
                information down from generation to generation, but it is a way for us to move forward towards a more hopeful future as a society.  When I read about the history 
                of US education the dates and events listed appeared just as bullet points leading from the past to the present.  But that is not all that they are: 
                Each of the bullet points represented a tremendous amount of human effort to reshape the world into something more fair and kind.
            </p>
            <p>I also gained a clearer view of how teacher fulfil their role.  As I read through the dozens of resources that were used in this course, I understood that 
                good teaching can't exist in isolation.  Teachers need support from other teachers, and teachers need support from society through the policies of our government.  
                These insights have changed how I think about education, not only as a possible career path but also as a public good that deserves protection.
            </p>
            <p>As I continue my studies at UNC Charlotte, and especially in my role as an instructional assistant in the upcoming fall semester, I plan to apply what I've learned 
                to stay engaged with my students.  I want to approach teaching with empathy, equity, and the skill required to be an effective instructor.  I also want to continue 
                to identify as a learner, both in my roles as a student, and as a teacher, and throughout my life no matter where it takes me.  Wether I pursue education professionally, 
                or I support teachers through my advocacy as a citizen, I now hold the belief that the work of teachers is vital in shaping the future to build a better world.
